5. [Scripts](#scripts) *Work in progress*

## Run the App
The app use Docker to run the React project. The Docker image uses [Node Alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/) to abstract away the need to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).

**After new dependencies** or **first time** run:

``docker-compose up --build``

To start:

``docker-compose up``

To stop:

``cmd(ctrl) + c`` or ``docker-compose down``

**Windows users** should use **192.168.99.100** for their **localhost**.

Please follow the instructions to [setup docker](#docker), in case you don't have it installed.

**Burn everything with Hellfire:**

```
docker stop `docker ps -qa`
docker rm -f `docker ps -qa`
docker rmi `docker images -q`
```
*Note*

I need to add the production build for Docker.

## Test the App

To test the app bash into the docker container:

``docker-compose exec web sh``

Once in the container's terminal:

``npm run test``

## Folder Structure

The folder structure uses the [Fractals folder system](https://hackernoon.com/fractal-a-react-app-structure-for-infinite-scale-4dab943092af).

### Summary:

- **build** is where all the built files go, you never touch this except when you need to deploy.
- **public** is where your index.html file and <script src> assets go. (They automatically get copied to build while using create-react-app)
src is where you code.
- **src.pages** are the root level components, ones which are directly mounted on level 1 routes. (Ex. if you have a route called /login that mounts a Login component, then Login.js will be present in pages directory).
- **src.modules** handles your state (actions + reducers using ducks file structure).
- **src.components** have shared components, like Button, Input etc.
- **src.utils** have utilities like your API wrapper, date utils, string utils etc.
- **config** is where you store your environment variables like API endpoints. Don’t commit this to git.
- **store** initializes the redux store.
- **index** registers the routes and renders the app.

## Docker

To start:

``docker-compose up``

To stop:

``docker-compose down``

### Disclaimer!

A major difference between Docker for Mac vs. Docker for Windows is that you **will not be able to use localhost anymore**! See [Note](#note)

### Mac Users

Mac users should visit [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and download the **Docker CE**.
Click on your appropriate OS, next you will be taken to the [store](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows). Click on the **Please Login to Download** button and sign up for a docker account.

### Windows Users

If you are a Windows Home user, you will not be able install the Docker for Windows Desktop edition, as it requires Hyper-V virtualization. This is supported only by Windows Professional and Enterprise editions.

Windows Home users will need to install Docker Toolbox which uses VirtualBox instead. Please follow the instructions below for installation:

[Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/)

You may also need to enable virtualization in your computer's BIOS settings. This will be different for each manufacturer, please refer to their documentation on which keys to use to access these settings on reboot.

#### Note

As mentioned before to access **localhost** on Windows use **192.168.99.100**

You'll also notice a ``.env`` file inside the root directory, this is to enable **Hot Module Reloading** for Windows users!

## Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
